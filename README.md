## ENIAC and MAGIST 

Eniac is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories. It was founded 10 years ago in Spain and it has since grown and expanded to other neighboring countries.
Eniac is exploring an expansion to the Brazilian market. The problem, for Eniac, is the lack of knowledge of such a market. 
The company doesn’t have ties with local providers, package delivery services, or customer service agencies. 
Here comes Magist. Magist is a Brazilian Software as a Service company that offers a centralized order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces.
Now, Eniac is considering signing a contract with Magist but there are two main concerns:
1. Eniac’s catalog is 100% tech products, and heavily based on Apple-compatible accessories. It is not clear that the marketplaces Magist works with are a good place for these high-end tech products.
2. Among Eniac’s efforts to have happy customers, fast deliveries are key. The delivery fees resulting from Magist’s deal with the public Post Office might be cheap, but at what cost? Are deliveries fast enough?
